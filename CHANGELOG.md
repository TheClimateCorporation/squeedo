## Unreleased

* protect clients from aggressive consumer dequeueing when the SQS client returns an exception.
  introduces new configuration option, `:exceptional-poll-delay-ms`, with a new default
  behavior of timing out for 10 seconds if an exception occurs when dequeueing. (thanks @stephencrampton!)
* by default, use `.getStringValue` when clojurifying MessageAttributeValue objects. (thanks @danieltdt!)

## 1.0.2 (September 25, 2018)

* refactor consumer implementation to shorten class file names (#43).

## 1.0.1 (April 24, 2018)

* option to run listeners in dedicated threads instead of in core.async go
  threads (#37).

## 1.0.0 (February 26, 2018)

* no changes from `1.0.0-beta2`.

## 1.0.0-beta2 (December 7, 2017)

* support FIFO message attributes in `com.climate.squeedo.sqs/enqueue` via `:message-group-id` and `:message-deduplication-id`.

## 1.0.0-beta1 (November 20, 2017)

* **BREAKING**
  * queue attributes are only set via `com.climate.squeedo.sqs/configure-queue`
    (replaces `com.climate.squeedo.sqs/set-queue-attrubutes` from 0.2.2).
    * `com.climate.squeedo.sqs/configure-queue` will create the specified
      queue (and dead letter queue) if it does not exist.
    * removed attribute options from `com.climate.squeedo.sqs/mk-connection`.
      this function now only makes a connection and returns a reusable connection object.
      a `QueueDoesNotExistException` exception will be thrown if the queue does not exist
      (for convenience, `com.climate.squeedo.sqs/configure-queue` can be used
      to create the queue first).
    * removed dead letter queue option in `com.climate.squeedo.sqs-consumer/start-consumer`.
      use `com.climate.squeedo.sqs/configure-queue` to set up dead letter queue.
    * removed the default behavior of creating a dead letter queue when starting a
      consumer.

## 0.2.3 (November 20, 2017)

* fix default dead letter queue in SQS consumer when queue is a FIFO queue
* support creating a FIFO queue when connecting to one that does not exist

## 0.2.2 (November 9, 2017)

* support and validate FIFO queue names (thanks @lainiewright!)
* **BREAKING**
  * queue attributes are only set when `com.climate.squeedo.sqs/mk-connection` creates a new sqs queue
    * if an existing queue is found, queue attributes are not applied (this includes dead-letter/redrive configuration)
    * squeedo will emit a `WARN` log when this occurs
    * allows reading from queues that already exist for consumers without create permissions (#34)
    * new api function, `com.climate.squeedo.sqs/set-queue-attributes`, which allows ad-hoc calls to set attributes
    for those who need it
  * support binary message attributes (#30)
  * remove bandalore as a source dependency

## 0.2.1 (June 26, 2017)

* consumer middleware for deserialization and exception logging

## 0.2.0 (June 26, 2017)

* adjustable visibility timeout in consumer api via `:nack timeout`
* updated deps: `[org.clojure/core.async "0.3.442"]`
